This project will be a game called Battle City, where a user's randomly generated character "fights" another randomly generated character.    

This README file will contain explanations of the technologies used and the approach taken, as well as a link to the live site, installation instructions, a list of unsolved problems, etc.

I'll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the game.  The choice of characters will come from an array, and the chose character's property values will be randomly assigned.  The gameplay mechanism will mirror that of Space Battle.  The user attacks.  If the opponent is defeated, the user can fight another opponent or quit the game.  Otherwise the opponent gets to attack, with the same outcome tree.  The process continues until someone is defeated.

The live site for this game is: https://https://johnvresilovic.github.io/mod1
